### Multi-threaded Chat
This repository contains a C program consisting of a Client and Server simulating the TCP/Ip (Transmission Control) protocol.
In this project, the server side can handle more than one client at a time and provides private messaging between two connected clients. The program has "Simple Parity check" and "Cyclic redundancy check" error detection algorithms. It also saves a copy of the chat as a text file. There are code sections that perform the client side when someone has connected or disconnected and return a list of active clients.
